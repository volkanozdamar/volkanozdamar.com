    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like an architecture history, software architecture has changed and evolved. First of all, people started to live in cave, then they build their shed and tent, from them shed and tent to today‚Äôs skyscraper and apartment, lots of come a long way.<a id="more"></a> Like this, our software architecture started to evolve from early 2005.Microservices start to rise behind the hill and with Cloud Services, Docker and container orchestration, we have a more distributed, more scalable, and reliable solutions more than from the past. Why we choose that way and Is the old way still applicable for us? Let see what is the differences between monolith and microservices.</p><h2 id="Monolithic-Architecture"><a href="#Monolithic-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Monolithic Architecture"></a><strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong></h2><p>As a word monolith means monument or building made with a single massive stone or rock. With this perspective, if an application has one more module in a single repository, we can define it as a monolithic application.<br>This type of applications generally combination of single client, single server and single database. This singularity comes with some eases, but comes with some difficulties too. A big challenge with this type of application; update, upgrade or crash and restart scenarios affect whole system situation. This kind of architectures also tightly coupled with interdependencies and increased information flow.</p><h3 id="Advantages-of-Monolithic"><a href="#Advantages-of-Monolithic" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Monolithic"></a>Advantages of Monolithic</h3><ul><li>Easy bug tracking and end to end testing</li><li>Easy development</li><li>Easy deployment (generally once a week and big)</li></ul><h3 id="Disadvantages-of-Monolithic"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Monolithic" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Monolithic"></a>Disadvantages of Monolithic</h3><ul><li>Technology dependency, hard to implement new technologies</li><li>Complexity of one code base</li><li>Can be lead anti-pattens</li><li>CI/CD difficult</li><li>uncontrollable growth with every new feature</li></ul><h2 id="Microservice-Architecture"><a href="#Microservice-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Microservice Architecture"></a><strong>Microservice Architecture</strong></h2><p>While monolithic applications is a single unified unit , microservices breaks it down into a collection of independent pieces.Like one piece a car toy versus a car maded with lego , every bricks has a unique job to done and create to whole system as together. These pieces can be deployable independently from each other, and has own logic , database , pipeline and codebases too.These applications communicate with each other through defined methods called APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).Big advantage of microservices scalability and reliability.</p><h3 id="Advantages-of-Monolithic-1"><a href="#Advantages-of-Monolithic-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Monolithic"></a>Advantages of Monolithic</h3><ul><li>Independent components</li><li>Easier to understanding</li><li>Each service has its own codebase</li><li>Loosely Coupled</li><li>Scalability</li><li>Reliablity</li><li>Technology flexible</li></ul><h3 id="Disadvantages-of-Monolithic-1"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Monolithic-1" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Monolithic"></a>Disadvantages of Monolithic</h3><ul><li>Integration testing is diffucult</li><li>Deployment are more complex </li><li>Operation cost for each apps<ul><li>own repo</li><li>own codebase and CI/CD</li><li>own database</li></ul></li><li>Additional hardware costs</li></ul><h2 id="Which-one-is-the-best"><a href="#Which-one-is-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Which one is the best ?"></a><strong>Which one is the best ?</strong></h2><p>There is no exact answer, it depends on your application size, team knowledge and your budget.</p><p>If you a small team, don‚Äôt want to do not have performance bottlenecks, don‚Äôt want deal with Dev-Ops costs and have experiences with Monolithics frameworks, this could be best solution for you. Vice versa, if you have a big cluster and need to scalability and reliability and want to use one more technology in same time or want to experience to microservices, this could be best solution too.</p> <img src="/Monolithic-vs-MicroService-Architecture/microswerviceworld.png" class="img-fluid" title="&#x2F;Monolithic-vs-MicroService-Architecture&#x2F;microswerviceworld.png" alt="Monolithic vs Microservices">]]></content>

With Virtual Machine(VM) technology, you can share your hardware resources on one computer with separated Virtual Machines. Each VM require reserved hard disk installed OS on this disk and virtual components reserved from the host machine. This reduced hardware costs however, maintenance cost increased cus managing this machine and reserve a resource for each machine needs to proficiency.</p><h2 id="Then-What-is-Containers"><a href="#Then-What-is-Containers" class="headerlink" title="Then¬†, What is Containers¬†?"></a><strong>Then¬†, What is Containers¬†?</strong></h2><p>Simply containers, virtual layers to run your apps and services abstractly on each one on Docker with self-reliant off your host operating system.No matter, which operating system running on your computer, Docker runs your docker containers on your machine. Contrary to old VMs, containers run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers. When doing that, Docker does not do Hardware-level process isolation, the processes of each container are isolating from each other. This feature makes Docker fast and more manageable beside on VMs.<br>¬†Just notice that Docker has two type containers, commonly preferred one is Linux containers and you can use this containers on every OS. Other alternative is Windows containers, uses Hyper-V* and works with Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise or Windows Server 2016.No concern if you have the other versions of Windows. With Virtual Box you can run Docker containers on your system but it will be a reason of a Lil‚Äô bit headache for you.<br>*On Windows¬†, Hyper-V runs a Linux VM(Moby-LinuxVM) to run Docker and Linux containers.</p> <img src="/Just-Another-Docker-Related-Post/dockervsvm.png" class="img-fluid" title="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;what-container" alt="Docker vs. Virtual¬†Machine"><h2 id="What-is-Inside-of-Containers"><a href="#What-is-Inside-of-Containers" class="headerlink" title="What is Inside of Containers¬†?"></a><strong>What is Inside of Containers¬†?</strong></h2><p>Containers has a real operating system and environment variables.We are defining which operating system should be run on with  which environment variables and  setup of our software projects and dependencies.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-Containerization"><a href="#Benefits-of-Containerization" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Containerization"></a><strong>Benefits of Containerization</strong></h2> <img src="/Just-Another-Docker-Related-Post/landscape.png" class="img-fluid" title="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landscape.cncf.io&#x2F;" alt="CNCF Landscape"><p>Docker popularity puts it  under a wide range support umberalla with tons of DevOps, CI /CD tools and cloud services.Additionally Docker provide some benefits coming  from its nature.</p><ul><li>Environmental Isolation¬†</li><li>Lightweight Virtualization</li><li>Raises productivity</li><li>Standardize CI&amp;CD</li><li>Easy Portable &amp; Scalable</li></ul>]]></content>
